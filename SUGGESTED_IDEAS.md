# Suggested Future Functionality

This document outlines potential enhancements for the Video Slideshow Automation project, building upon its current capabilities.

## Content & Visual Enhancements:

1.  **Text Overlays/Captions:**
    *   **Description:** Allow adding text overlays or captions to individual slides or the entire video. This could be sourced from a text file associated with the image, metadata, or directly via Matrix commands.
    *   **Benefit:** Provides context, storytelling, or branding for the slideshows.

2.  **Image Transitions:**
    *   **Description:** Implement various transition effects between images (e.g., fade, slide, wipe). The type of transition could be configurable globally or per image.
    *   **Benefit:** Makes the slideshow more dynamic and visually appealing.

3.  **Dynamic Image Sourcing:**
    *   **Description:** Integrate with other image sources beyond Nextcloud (e.g., RSS feeds, specific web albums like Flickr or Google Photos API, or even local directories that are watched for new images).
    *   **Benefit:** Increases flexibility and automation by pulling content from diverse locations.

4.  **Video Clips Integration:**
    *   **Description:** Allow short video clips to be included as "slides" within the slideshow, seamlessly integrating them with images and music.
    *   **Benefit:** Adds another dimension to the content, allowing for more engaging presentations.

## Output & Customization:

5.  **Multiple Output Formats/Resolutions:**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to specify the output video format (e.g., MP4, WebM) and resolution (e.g., 720p, 1080p, 4K).
    *   **Benefit:** Caters to different playback environments and quality requirements.

6.  **Per-Image Slide Duration:**
    *   **Description:** Instead of a fixed duration for all slides, allow specifying individual durations for each image, perhaps through a configuration file or image metadata.
    *   **Benefit:** Provides finer control over pacing and emphasis.

7.  **Watermarking/Branding:**
    *   **Description:** Option to add a custom watermark or logo to the generated video.
    *   **Benefit:** Useful for branding or copyright purposes.
